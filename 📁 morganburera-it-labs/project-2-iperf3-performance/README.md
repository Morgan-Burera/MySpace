# Project 2 â€“ Iperf3 Network Performance Test

Tested network **bandwidth and latency** under normal and degraded conditions using `iperf3` and `tc`.

## ðŸ§° Tools
- Ubuntu 22.04, iperf3, Wireshark, tc, tshark

## ðŸ§ª What I did
- Measured throughput in Mbps with iperf3
- Simulated latency and packet loss (200ms, 5%)
- Analyzed TCP retransmissions and handshake behavior
